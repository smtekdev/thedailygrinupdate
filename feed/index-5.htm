										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Sometimes you just have to have people over for<br>dinner.</p>



<p>You don’t want to, but those long, boney fingers of<br>guilt have got you in their crosshairs. Could be for<br>new neighbors, visiting relatives or it’s simply “your<br>turn” after a few years of successfully avoiding it.<br>Let’s admit it, having dinner guests is one of life’s<br>minor stresses: not enough to start cutting yourself<br>or anything, but enough to keep the sandman away.</p>



<p>Who to invite, who gets along with whom, who sits<br>next to whom. What to serve, who’s vegan, who<br>won’t eat pork, who’s gluten intolerant. Who loves<br>your pets, who hates your pets. Cleaning the house,<br>cutting the lawn, trimming the hedges. Making your<br>spouse promise NOT to bring up politics, making<br>your teenager promise NOT to belch, fart or drop an<br>“F” bomb…it’s a serious undertaking that the<br>makers of Ambien have built one helluva business<br>on.</p>



<p>But there’s always “Fantasy Dinner.” You may have<br>played it but just didn’t call it that. It starts with a<br>question: “If you could invite ANYONE, dead or<br>alive, to dinner who would you invite?” It usually<br>has a limit as to how many guests you can invite<br>that all players must agree to. If you’ve never<br>played this game, I can tell you now, that’s the hard<br>part.</p>



<p>Remember, you can pick ANYONE who’s ever lived!<br>George Washington, Charlie Chaplin, Michele<br>Obama, Don Knots, Bill Clinton. But let’s say<br>everyone agreed to limit the number of guests to<br>ten. You can think of hundreds that would be great<br>to invite, but you’ve only got ten seats. It’s tough to<br>eliminate someone like Abraham Lincoln, but Elvis<br>wold be awesome. That’s the tough part.</p>



<p>You don’t have to give a philosophical reason why<br>each guest was invited or eliminated unless you<br>want to.</p>



<p>I’ve got a list of a dozen (which I’ll share later). I<br>cannot seem to cut it down (ten guests is ideal, but<br>not a rule) for various reasons and I’m always<br>coming up with someone else that would be just<br>perfect. But I’ve got to stick to the number<br>everyone agreed to. If I add that new, “perfect”<br>guest, I’d have to eliminate another previously<br>“perfect” guest which makes it hard and makes it<br>fun.</p>



<p>The interesting part starts with the people you<br>choose and why. But what gets really interesting is<br>who you keep and who you eliminate, and why.</p>



<p>But again, you don’t have to give a philosophical<br>reason why each guest was invited or eliminated to<br>anyone…unless it’s to yourself. Was it because of<br>race? Gender? Occupation? Reputation? When you<br>study your reasons for a moment, you learn about<br>yourself which can be very eye-opening and even a<br>bit frightening.</p>



<p>Are there too many men? Did you add Indira<br>Ghandi just because she’s a woman? Or because</p>



<p>she represents a race that your list lacks? Should<br>you include someone from every religion? Every<br>race? If you include Malcolm X should you eliminate<br>Martin Luther King, Jr? You’ll end up with people<br>you don’t necessarily like on your list, but they fill a<br>“genre” you feel you need like sex or race. And then<br>there’s the whole consideration of what the other<br>game participants will think of your list and you!</p>



<p>Okay…my list. I realize as I type with two fingers<br>that this is a semi-dangerous undertaking. First, all<br>but one of my guests is dead. Second, you’re going<br>to either hate or love someone on my list and<br>frankly, my dear, I don’t give a damn. Oooh, Clark<br>Gable!</p>



<p>Maybe I’ll eliminate Kurt Vonnegut and include<br>Clark Gable…or maybe eliminate Caitlin Jenner and<br>add Katherine Hepburn or Michele Obama. Or<br>maybe replace Christian Dior with Vince<br>Lombardi…or…or…</p>



<p>MY LIST:<br>Jesus Christ</p>



<p>Abraham Lincoln<br>Muhammad Ali<br>Eleanor Roosevelt<br>Maya Angelou<br>Sitting Bull<br>Kurt Vonnegut<br>Martin Luther King, Jr<br>Adolph Hitler<br>John Lennon<br>Barack Obama<br>Carl Sagan</p>



<p>Now that should make for some interesting dinner<br>conversation, don’t you think?</p>



<p>But that’s my list. I would LOVE, LOVE, LOVE to see<br>yours. What the hey…send it to me at<br>jackcardone28@gmail.com. If you DO send me your<br>guest list, make sure to title it DINNER in all caps!<br>That way I won&#8217;t immediately delete it.</p>



<p>It’s not a contest, sweepstakes or give away. You<br>won’t receive anything accept my appreciation. And</p>



<p>the only thing I’ll get is the ability to steal names I<br>hadn’t thought of and add them to my list.</p>



<p>Of course, then I’d have to eliminate people on my<br>list…see what I mean? BRAIN TWISTER: If you invite<br>The Invisible Man, does he count as a guest? Hey,<br>he’s invisible!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[No matter who you are, you want to be someoneelse. C’mon, tell the truth…don’t you secretly want to bea cowboy? [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>No matter who you are, you want to be someone<br>else.</p>



<p>C’mon, tell the truth…don’t you secretly want to be<br>a cowboy? Or a dolphin trainer? Or George<br>Clooney? Or maybe just thinner, or heavier or<br>better at starting a conversation?</p>



<p>I (not so secretly) always wanted to be a<br>professional musician. I picture myself up there<br>playing guitar alongside Eric Clapton or Stevie Ray<br>Vaughn. Knockin’ ‘em dead with my solos. Climbing<br>the speaker towers to the amazement of my<br>screaming fans. Of course, it would help if I could,<br>first, make a G chord.</p>



<p>What’s with us, anyway? The phrase, “Snap out of<br>it” comes to mind. But it doesn’t have to.</p>



<p>I retired about two years ago and moved up here to<br>Adirondack Park…far away from anyone who knows<br>me. And I remember thinking, “Now you can be<br>anyone you want to be.” Of course, I was wrong for<br>the most part. But I have become someone that I<br>wasn’t – friendlier, more open to new adventures,<br>eager to meet new people. Hell, I’ve even begun<br>showing interest in cooking of all things &#8211;<br>unfathomable! But I’m basically the same…just not<br>always.</p>



<p>Before you start thinking that I’m bi-polar or<br>schizophrenic, hear me out.</p>



<p>I went into Kinney Drugs in Tupper Lake a while ago<br>to pick up a few things. (If you don’t mind, let me<br>take a minute to acknowledge one of the<br>friendliest, most helpful staffs I’ve ever come across<br>in a retail establishment…especially Daryl, the<br>pharmacist.) If the grand total had come in under<br>$100, I’d have paid with cash as I normally do. But<br>since a few prescriptions were among the items on<br>my list, the total was well over my cash limit, so I<br>whipped out a credit card.</p>



<p>I don’t know about you, but I still don’t know when I<br>have to sign my name when buying on credit and<br>when it isn’t necessary. Further, I don’t know what<br>the point of signing either on a paper receipt or an<br>electronic screen is…you just need to scribble pretty<br>much anything and you’re good to go. It’s not like<br>the card company is looking at the accuracy of your<br>signature anymore to make sure it was you. As I<br>picked up the pen to sign, I thought to myself, “Hell,<br>I could be George Clooney and just sign it that way if<br>I wanted to.” Hey, wait a minute!</p>



<p>Remember how this needlessly long ramble<br>started? With everyone wanting to be someone<br>else? My opportunity just presented itself on<br>Demars Blvd. So, with my worst penmanship, I<br>signed George Clooney. Of course, it looked<br>nothing like Mr. Clooney’s signature…like all other<br>signatures, it was just a scribble. What it DID do,<br>however, was allow me to be someone I’m not,<br>albeit in a brief, cheap, meaningless, borderline<br>legal way. But here’s the fun part – after I signed, I<br>felt and behaved like George Clooney.</p>



<p>Suddenly, I walked taller. I was dressed in a tuxedo.<br>I smiled and waved at everyone as if I had just<br>strolled off the red carpet. If I didn’t think I’d get<br>slapped and berated I would have winked at the<br>women I passed. When I got to my car, it was<br>transformed into a Porsche, not the 2010 Toyota<br>Prius with the missing bumper that I had driven into<br>the Kinney parking lot. Yes, I had become George<br>Clooney until I walked in the door and saw someone<br>who actually knew me…my wife…who was NOT<br>Amal, but was just as beautiful, smart and sexy! (My<br>wife reads my column.)</p>



<p>Ever since that fateful day, I look forward to being<br>asked to sign my name for credit. Oh, I’ve been<br>many, many different people…David Bowie, Walter<br>White, Yosemite Sam, Olivia de Havilland (signing in<br>drag is tricky, and especially challenging afterward<br>when I’m trying to act like a woman). You should try<br>it…it’s VERY liberating.</p>



<p>Who knows? If enough of us do it, maybe the credit<br>card companies will do away with signing</p>



<p>altogether…they’ll trust us to be who we truly are<br>without a proper signature…like Prince.</p>



<p>Boy, now I have GOT to learn to make that G chord!</p>



<p>PULL QUOTE: The phrase, “Snap out of it” comes to<br>mind.</p>

<p><strong>To everything,<br>Turn, turn, turn<br>There is a season,<br>Turn, turn, turn</strong></p>



<p>It’s wood season in the Adirondacks. Chopping it,<br>splitting it, burning it…it gets more attention than<br>many spouses.</p>



<p>I never realized how much trees and, more<br>specifically, wood, was a part of our lives until I was<br>living in Adirondack Park. The word “Adirondack”<br>itself translates from the Mohawk tribe’s language<br>to mean “Eater of trees.”</p>



<p>Whether it’s twig decorations, log cabins or rustic<br>McMansions, so much is built from trees and wood<br>up here.</p>



<p>That includes the good old English language.</p>



<p>Yep. When you think about it, (as only idea-starved<br>writers do), you’ll be amazed…okay maybe not<br>amazed, perhaps slightly amused, at how many of<br>the words we use each day are plucked from trees<br>and wood(or so it seems), providing more than<br>oxygen and souvenir salt and pepper shakers.<br>They’ve created a lexicon all their own. Check it out:</p>



<p>When a performer’s act is over, what do they do?<br>He or she LEAVES the stage.</p>



<p>And when I get a new Duluth Trading catalogue in<br>the mail I might LEAF through it.</p>



<p>Take any yoga class and one of the first things you’ll<br>be instructed to do is something called a PLANK.</p>



<p>Big banks like Bank of America can’t have<br>headquarters in every city under the sun, so they<br>have BRANCHES.</p>



<p>It’s absolutely astonishing what orthopedic<br>medicine is doing with prosthetic LIMBS these days.</p>



<p>My grandson told me elephants like to travel<br>because they have TRUNKS. I told him, no,<br>that’s what they go swimming in!</p>



<p>My dogs BARK…at anything.</p>



<p>One of my neighbors, Cal, has a bum leg, so instead<br>of walking, he LUMBERS.</p>



<p>His wife, Evelyn, is a huge Facebook fan. I find her<br>on there whenever I LOG on.</p>



<p>After a long hike, you can almost sit and watch my<br>calves KNOT up in front of your eyes.</p>



<p>My cousin, Peter, once did one of those DNA tests<br>to investigate our ROOTS.</p>



<p>He told me confidentially that he found a lot of<br>crazies in our family TREE.</p>



<p>My sister-in-law will believe anything. She’s such a<br>SAP.</p>



<p>I love to NEEDLE her about that</p>



<p>The only Christmas music I can stand to listen to is<br>sung by BURL Ives.</p>



<p>Sometimes I’m humbled to think that, with this<br>column, the FRUITS of my labor might end up lining<br>the bottom of a bird cage.</p>



<p>My cousin, Owen, and his wife, Melody, make an<br>odd sort of couple. He’s kind of a STUMP of a guy<br>and she’s such a TWIG.</p>



<p>They’re huge New York Jets fans, and PINE for a<br>winning season.</p>



<p>A few years back, the Jets held one in the PALMS of<br>their hands and blew it.</p>



<p>Once in a while, I have the tendency to take a<br>simple concept like this and beat it to a PULP.</p>



<p>Okay, okay…you get the idea. And there are more<br>words that emerge from those dense providers of<br>shade, baseball bats and end tables. Feel free to<br>think of others…it’s fun!</p>



<p>Now many folks might read this column and think<br>that I took the easy way out. That a column about<br>words doesn’t constitute a real column of words.<br>They might say I didn’t give this week’s submission<br>much thought…just slapped it together and ran.</p>



<p>Such accusations go against my GRAIN and attack<br>the very FIBER of my being.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I don’t despise camping, I merely hate it. Yes, I realize where I live now and I know residentsof Adirondack [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I don’t despise camping, I merely hate it.</p>



<p>Yes, I realize where I live now and I know residents<br>of Adirondack Park are not supposed to say such<br>things — it’s blasphemous. But, c’mon. I’m no<br>Jeremiah Johnson and even that poor S.O.B. froze<br>to death while getting “back to nature.” And don’t<br>get me wrong. I love the forests, the lakes, the<br>mountains, the air! And I love being out in it. I just<br>don’t want to LIVE out in it. If I want to “rough it” I’ll<br>go stay at a Budget Inn.</p>



<p>Now I’ve read about an alternative to camping<br>that’ll probably get me drummed out of this man’s<br>mountain range just for mentioning it: glamping.</p>



<p>I guess it’s short for “glamorous camping.” And,<br>while I’ve never done it, from the sound of it and<br>the price of it, it certainly is that. ”Glampers” get<br>the best sites, huge tents with multiple rooms, cots<br>that are more like beds with fresh linens every</p>



<p>night, chefs preparing 3 gourmet meals per day<br>(plus snacks!) that you eat at a table and chairs with<br>china and silverware, wine and cocktails, plus<br>guides, experts…the whole nine…with everything<br>from walking sticks to binoculars to bug spray<br>provided. Some would argue that that ain’t<br>camping…and it ain’t.</p>



<p>Real camping means pain. Like those religious folks<br>who are always flogging themselves, real campers<br>relish the pain…bathe in it, even boast of it. If you’re<br>not sleeping in a leaky tent with your feet above<br>your head on a slight slope and a root sticking into<br>your back all night long, you ain’t camping. If you’re<br>not eating a fair amount of dirt mixed in with your<br>ramen noodles, you ain’t camping. If you’re not<br>cold, wet, hungry, filthy, itchy, totally exhausted<br>and praying for a good night’s rest …you ain’t<br>camping.</p>



<p>Camping always starts out great. My wife and I are<br>light-hearted and excited. We think we have<br>everything we’ll need for a fantastic trip<br>communing with nature and all that. The weather</p>



<p>lady said brief periods of light rain followed by<br>clearing skies for a few days. Perfect. The initial rain<br>will scare others off and we’ll be the only ones out<br>there! Except that’s what everybody else is thinking.</p>



<p>To that point, the pain starts with finding a camp<br>site that isn’t occupied and then choosing between<br>the site on the uphill slope or the downhill slope.<br>Next comes arguing over how to pitch the tent,<br>followed by the realization of all the things that I, of<br>course, forgot: headlamps, fire starters, tent repair<br>kit, extra socks, band aids — the full list is<br>heartbreaking…and expected.</p>



<p>What follows is the internal cursing out of the<br>weather lady (meteorologist my fanny!) when it<br>starts to drizzle, then rain, then come down in<br>torrents. You scurry into your tent where you only<br>have to deal with a few leaks. How those leaks find<br>the worst possible locations in your tent is a<br>mystery of the universe that Carl Sagan couldn’t<br>explain: over your food, over your clothes, over<br>your sleeping spot. The good news is you were<br>smart enough to anticipate the worst and</p>



<p>purchased a tent repair kit…that’s sitting dry, warm<br>and comfortably at home.</p>



<p>But enough camp-bashing. Here’s the truth: these<br>days I live in a comfortably warm, dry cabin in the<br>woods on the shores of a pristine lake. Yet, for<br>reasons unknown, every once in a while, I yearn to<br>go camping — to feel that root in my back. To<br>dodge the leaks in my tent. To go hungry, to get<br>filthy, to stay cold, damp and utterly exhausted<br>while sustaining small injuries for days on end.</p>



<p>And then I think, or maybe I’ll just stay home and<br>start flogging myself instead.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[There’s a hidden treasure in Adirondack Park. You don’t need a treasure map and it’s not markedwith a great big [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There’s a hidden treasure in Adirondack Park.</p>



<p>You don’t need a treasure map and it’s not marked<br>with a great big “X.” Instead, it’s marked with a<br>great big “S.” Followed by a “t.” Then an “e.” Then<br>“w, a, r, t, ‘, s.” Put them all together and what do<br>you have?</p>



<p>You have an incredibly diversified treasure of<br>resources. As all of you probably already know, but<br>I’ve only recently discovered, Stewart’s is a place<br>where one can pick up ice cream as well as gasoline.<br>Advil and motor oil. Pizza, air fresheners, beef jerky,<br>smokes, bungee cords, nail polish, Cup-O-Noodles,<br>fishing lures, coffee, kindling, pudding, bug spray, a<br>damn good sandwich and, of course, Super Softee<br>Donuts. But that’s just the beginning.</p>



<p>Stewarts is also where you can pick up the latest<br>news. Yes, they carry the Adirondack Daily<br>Enterprise, but I’m talking about supplemental<br>news. For instance: I was in Stewarts recently and,</p>



<p>while waiting in line to buy my Super Softee Donuts,<br>I happened to overhear a conversation between<br>two women that maybe I shouldn’t have…but did.<br>Now, I fully expected to hear something about the<br>Rail Trail or the fire that took out Aubuchon’s, or<br>maybe an insight about our local school board.</p>



<p>Instead, I heard a tidbit regarding Jesus of all things.<br>Yes, that Jesus. My ears perked up immediately.<br>What I heard was this: according to one woman,<br>Jesus had a middle name. The other woman was<br>astonished, as was I. Despite years of catholic<br>school under my belt, I had never heard that He had<br>a middle name! This was exciting stuff!!!</p>



<p>The funny thing (and I mean FUNNY) is that the first<br>woman said that his middle name was Harold.<br>Harold? I wasn’t sure my ears were working<br>properly. I wanted to ask, but of course, being<br>polite and fairly new to the area, I didn’t: “You<br>mean Mary actually named her son Jesus Harold<br>Christ???”</p>



<p>Okay, all of you Harolds out there can cool your jets.<br>Harold is a fine name. It just seems odd for<br>someone in the Bible, let alone Jesus Christ, to be<br>called “Harold” don’t you think? It’s just<br>too…current. Might as well be Gus or Charlie or<br>Skeeter. It does, however, explain the one phrase<br>that I’ve heard which never made any sense to me.<br>But I suppose He could have signed His checks with,<br>“Jesus H. Christ.” Or maybe I’ve just been hearing<br>the lyrics to that one Christmas tune wrong all my<br>life: maybe it’s actually “Hark the Harold angels<br>sing.”</p>



<p>Now I know His mates probably didn’t go around<br>saying things like “Hey, Harold, what’s with the<br>sandals?” But I do wonder what name He went by<br>every day. Now, the ladies in line at Stewart’s didn’t<br>get into this, but they made me wonder: did folks<br>have nicknames back then?</p>



<p>As I crept closer to the Stewart’s cashier, my Super<br>Softees begging to be opened, I asked myself, did<br>Peter, Mark, Matthew and Paul call Jesus things like<br>Jeez? Or Halo-head? Or Cool J Messiah? I mean if</p>



<p>His middle name could be Harold, nicknames are<br>hardly a stretch. It was then that I finally reached<br>the counter and saw the cashier’s name tag on her<br>lapel. It read simply, Liz. This only fueled my<br>nickname fire.</p>



<p>I’ve got a neighbor we call Pot Roast. His wife is<br>called Shanky. Another neighbor is called Woody<br>which, given our location, is a little more<br>understandable. Strange thing about some<br>nicknames, though, is that they have a life<br>expectancy — it’s hard to continue calling someone<br>“Stinky”when they grow up to be a neurosurgeon.</p>



<p>On a personal note, the author has a lot in common<br>with the Kennedy clan. First, my legal name is John,<br>but everyone calls me Jack…same as President John<br>F. Kennedy. When I was a little shaver, my grandma<br>used to call me John-John…same as JFK Junior.<br>Jacqueline Kennedy was often called Jackie…my<br>entire family called me Jackie until I was, uh, well,<br>they still call me Jackie.</p>



<p>I got in my car, eagerly ripped open my donuts, and,<br>on my journey home, with white donut powder<br>wafting in the air, I felt a little sad. A little sad<br>because, first, I was leaving Stewart’s, but mostly<br>because, unlike Jesus Harold Christ, I was given a<br>nickname but never assigned a middle name and<br>I’ve always felt cheated by that.</p>



<p>Call it my cross to bear.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Fishing is huge up here…beyond huge…titanically<br>huge.</p>



<p>As you’re well aware, it’s the reason many, many<br>folks come to the North Country. And there are<br>folks within the park who truly like fish. Not to eat. I<br>mean really like them — appreciate their beauty,<br>their grace, their smarts. Okay, not all, but a lot.</p>



<p>I don’t fish. I’ve tried in various lakes and streams<br>but the only thing that ends up on my stringer is a<br>string of bad words. The weeds, the knots, the<br>attempts at pulling a hook out of a fish’s mouth<br>without ultimately pulling its guts out…not for me.<br>Plus the time it takes! Waiting for fish to bite, to me,<br>is torture. I’d rather be waiting for clothes to dry.</p>



<p>Of course, waiting for fish to bite is actually good for<br>a writer because 90 percent of writing is thinking<br>about what you’re going to write. And lord knows,<br>with me holding the pole, there’s plenty of time to<br>think. And one thought I had waiting to land the big<br>one was about the activities in a fish’s life:</p>



<p>Ever wonder what fish do down there all day?</p>



<p>After all, in a lake or ocean there are no cute little<br>castles to swim through, no colorful gravel or fake<br>little divers to trade aquatic jokes with. There’s<br>only…water. Okay, there may be a sunken relic they<br>can play around in now and again. Coral’s fun.<br>Weeds are nice for hide-and-seek, but I’m talking<br>about fish aspirations. Do they ever wish they could<br>go bowling? Or go shopping in Plattsburgh? Or get<br>together with friends for a game of Go Fish?</p>



<p>I only ask because I ran across this tidbit online the<br>other day:</p>



<p>Fish can now drive cars.</p>



<p>Before you call the Enterprise offices and ask Ms.<br>Izzo where she found such a chowder head of a<br>writer, hear me out. Or, better still, check out this<br>link (after you finish reading this fine piece of<br>journalism, of course) and see for yourself:<br>https://youtu.be/-DBAY7ywPpo?si=FcdyQ3v7Uzb8hV0W</p>



<p>You won’t see a mackerel driving an F-150 or a carp<br>parallel parking its Lexus. But you will see a little<br>goldfish steering its “car” time and time again over<br>to receive a reward in the form of a food pellet. So,<br>not only can a fish drive a car, he or she can actually<br>steer it exactly where they want to go! Shopping in<br>Plattsburgh? Bowling? A game of Go Fish? Pile in,<br>gang! And bring the school!</p>



<p>It is, of course, an experiment that simply proves<br>that fish can learn. That if they point their car over<br>to the right spot, they’ll be rewarded…like we do at<br>a drive-thru window!</p>



<p>Now, I think we all knew that fish have brains. And,<br>like most other animals, I think we all assumed that<br>fish could learn. That’s why they’re so hard to</p>



<p>catch! Maybe that’s why they stopped hitting your<br>spoon or your rubber worm….they’ve learned not<br>to fall for that one anymore. So, to me, that’s not<br>the only fascinating part of this experiment.</p>



<p>The fascinating part to me is less about the fish’s<br>intelligence, and more about the intelligence of the<br>humans who devised the experiment, then built a<br>little fish car that can somehow travel in whatever<br>direction a fish points to. Something about pulse<br>laser light, remote sensing technology and other<br>things I don’t understand make it possible. I just see<br>a fish driving a car and I’m amazed…at the<br>scientists.</p>



<p>So the next time you cast a line into Follensby or<br>Hoel or Lower Saranac, remember just how smart<br>fish are. I mean, we’ve taught them to drive! Just<br>like we’ve taught apes to understand and use<br>language. We’ve taught dogs to sniff out diseases.<br>Taught cats to, well…taught cats to…to take ALL of<br>the paper off a toilet paper roll! (Put the pens<br>down, cat people…I own two cats so I know they’re<br>very smart as well.)</p>



<p>I could go on and on about our relationship with<br>animals but I’m afraid I just don’t have the time…<br>I’ve got a flounder waiting to drive me to my dentist<br>appointment.</p>



<p>The other fascination here is our ability to teach and<br>therefore bend animal behavior. Long ago</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I was visiting the deli counter up in Heaven<br>yesterday and they had one of those “Take a<br>Number” thingys where you take one of those<br>little slips of paper with numbers on them. When<br>the deli man (in this case it was God wearing a<br>white apron and one of those little paper deli hats<br>cocked to one side) called the number on your<br>little slip, it was your turn to order up whatever it<br>is that you wanted. It was extremely crowded so I<br>knew I’d be there for a while.</p>



<p>As it turns out, the number that I pulled was 41. I<br>looked up at the board to see what position I was<br>in compared to the throng of people surrounding<br>me, but a hanging provolone cheese obscured my<br>view. So I asked the guy next to me what his<br>number was…turns out it was Bob<br>Seidenstein…curiously, his number was 41 as well.<br>Bob began explaining the history of winter and<br>the virtue of patience, but I had to move on<br>thinking I had found a flaw in the system. I asked</p>



<p>Ebony from the Adirondack Foot Clinic who stood<br>close by. Her number was 41. And Rick from the<br>Piercefield transfer station standing next to<br>her…his number was 41!</p>



<p>I soon realized everyone’s number was 41. At this<br>point God behind the counter seemed to be<br>growing a little impatient. In a booming, almost<br>thunderous voice, God asked, “Well, Cardone!<br>What’ll it be today?” Everyone’s head turned to<br>me, waiting for my reply. As I mumbled<br>something and tried to remember the deli items<br>on my shopping list, what came out of my gob-<br>smacked mouth was “Spring…can I get a half<br>pound of Spring?”</p>



<p>As my lips formed the words, a smile broke out on<br>God-The-Deli-Man’s face. After I had spoken, first<br>there was a giggle, then a snicker, then a guffaw,<br>then outright hysterical laughing from the crowd.<br>Mortified, I looked back at my little slip of paper<br>and saw some other writing on it that I hadn’t<br>seen previously. The teeny-tiny writing</p>



<p>underneath the number 41 read “days until<br>spring.”</p>



<p>41 days until Spring?</p>



<p>I slowly broke into tears, grabbed my face and<br>screamed, “NOOOOOOOOOO!!!” That’s when I<br>woke up in my bed, swaddled by two comforters<br>and two, now terrified, cats.</p>



<p>Yes, counting today, there are 41 more days of<br>cold, snow, ice, gloves, crampons, plows, shovels,<br>magnesium chloride, fleece-lined jeans, hand<br>warmers and wood stoves. 41 days of white. 41<br>days of gray. 41 days of thinking about 41 days.<br>Then 40 days of thinking about 40 days. And so on<br>until we reach SPRING!</p>



<p>I heard Bob still going on…“What about the<br>fabulous cross-country skiing, downhill skiing,<br>boarding, snow mobiling???”</p>



<p>Merely pass-times to take our minds off the wait,<br>that’s what I say. AND they require special shoes.</p>



<p>Many in Adirondack Park are waiting for spring to<br>arrive. What are we waiting for? For warmth, for<br>green. We’re waiting for sun. We’re waiting for<br>open water and paddling, swimming, fishing,<br>picnicking and ANYTHING that doesn’t require<br>layers!</p>



<p>That’s when I heard Bob continue on with this:<br>“AND HOW ABOUT WINTER CARNIVAL???”</p>



<p>He had a point. Without winter there’d be no<br>Winter Carnival! During Carnival the weather is<br>always perfect no matter the weather. It requires<br>no special shoes and everyone loves it. But it’s<br>just something else we all have to wait for!!!</p>



<p>I wasn’t about to give up that easily. “I’ll see your<br>Winter Carnival and raise you a Fourth of July.” A<br>hush fell over the crowd and God seemed<br>increasingly frustrated with me. “And another<br>thing,” I said looking the Supreme Deli Man in the</p>



<p>eye, “we only had to wait eight days for the whole,<br>entire world to be created! Now we have to wait 41<br>days for a little warmth???”</p>



<p>Through clenched teeth God spoke: “I<br>decree…Next year shall be one day shorter and<br>you will LEAP with joy.” I wondered if he had<br>punned on purpose. Then, in a lighter tone, “And<br>besides, Punxsutawney Phil didn’t see is shadow<br>this year. That means an early Spring!”</p>



<p>“Great,” I thought. “God leaves the seasons up to<br>a fat rodent from Pennsylvania.”</p>



<p>This year, Spring officially arrives on Tuesday, March<br>19 th . I, for one, can’t wait.</p>



<p>Embedded lyric quote:<br>“The waiting is the hardest part”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[“Changes come around real soon make uswomen and men.” Santa Claus (aka, Mr. Ken Waters) sat inSanta’s Magic Kingdom located [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>“Changes come around real soon make us<br>women and men.”</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>John Mellencamp</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Santa Claus (aka, Mr. Ken Waters) sat in<br>Santa’s Magic Kingdom located within<br>Korvettes Department Store waiting for the<br>curtain to be opened. He’d peaked out a<br>minute before and saw a long line of<br>children and their moms snaking around the<br>washers, ranges and dishwashers waiting<br>for their turn to sit on his lap.</p>



<p>Finally, the curtain parted and the first child<br>stepped up. He couldn’t have been more<br>than six or seven years old, so Santa</p>



<p>scooped him up and plopped him on his<br>lap. “Well, what’s your name, little boy?”<br>“Jimmy,” the boy replied. “And, Jimmy, what<br>do you want to be when you grow up?”<br>Santa inquired. Jimmy didn’t miss a beat.<br>“A close-minded, hate-spewing bigot.” he<br>said. “A bigot! Well that’s fine, Jim, that’s<br>fine. And what can Santa bring you for<br>Christmas?” Jimmy thought for a second,<br>looked down at his proud mommy and said,<br>“A Colt AR-15.” Santa’s eyes widened, “An<br>AR-15! Okay, Jimmy, you’ve got it.” “A<br>COLT AR-15,” Jimmy reminded him. “Ho-<br>ho-ho,” Santa replied, “A Colt AR-15…I’ll<br>pass it on to the elves.”</p>



<p>Next up was another little boy named Alex.<br>“And Alex, what do YOU want to be when<br>you grow up?” Santa asked. Alex thought</p>



<p>very hard, then said, “I want to be a<br>bleeding heart, vegan, tree hugger when I<br>grow up!” “Excellent, Alex, my boy…and<br>what can I bring YOU for Christmas?” “I<br>want a big sign on a stick that says, ‘DOWN<br>WITH EVERYTHING’.” “A great big protest<br>sign it is, Alex. But remember to be good<br>now!”</p>



<p>No one knows what they’re going to be<br>when they grow up. Nor do you know what<br>those random kids are going to grow up to<br>be when you make childhood friends with<br>them.</p>



<p>It’s called growing up.</p>



<p>I met most of my childhood friends when I<br>(and they) were between the ages of 5 and<br>9.<br>We were brothers. We hung out together,<br>played sports together, discovered girls,<br>discovered drugs, discovered heartbreak<br>together. Through high school we stuck like<br>glue and stuck up for each other. And then<br>a funny thing happened.</p>



<p>It’s called growing up.</p>



<p>I ended up going to college at The<br>University of Southern Mississippi…don’t<br>ask how or why. While away, I made a<br>discovery that literally changed my life: I<br>discovered that I could be whomever I<br>wanted to be. I didn’t have to be that big,<br>dumb Italian jock from New Jersey</p>



<p>anymore. I took art classes, photography<br>classes, read the books I was supposed to<br>read in high school. But maybe ,more<br>importantly, I made new friends. Friends<br>that I chose as an adult, not a 3 rd grader.<br>They were very different from my friends<br>back home. And they became my best<br>friends for life.</p>



<p>It’s called growing up.</p>



<p>This concept really hit home for me when<br>my second wife (BTW, this is true for<br>marriages as well) and I moved up here to<br>the Adirondacks far away from and out of<br>contact with our old friends. What<br>happened? We made some really good<br>new friends. Friends we chose when we’re<br>in our 50’s and 60’s. We share values,</p>



<p>political views, cultural interests, hatred of<br>black flies and love of a good long walk in<br>the woods.</p>



<p>But the changes we make in wives, in<br>friends, and in interests are nothing<br>compared to the changes we make in<br>ourselves. We accept that we no longer<br>think Mr. T is hilarious. That a tricked-out<br>Trans Am isn’t as cool as we once thought<br>it was. That Pop Tarts and a couple of<br>beers hardly makes a nutritious meal.</p>



<p>That getting older isn’t a bad thing.</p>



<p>It’s called growing up.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[“Never tell anyone outside the family what you’rethinking again.” – Don Corleone to Sonny Corleone Man, oh manicotti…If I was [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>“Never tell anyone outside the family what you’re<br>thinking again.” – Don Corleone to Sonny Corleone</p>



<p>Man, oh manicotti…If I was held to that golden rule<br>of mobdom, I’d be sleeping with the fishes. Not that<br>I necessarily have a big mouth. I do, but that’s not<br>what this piece is about.</p>



<p>It’s about my wardrobe.</p>



<p>Ever since I moved to the Adirondacks, I’m no<br>longer a clothes horse. I no longer have to be. I<br>don’t have to attend client meetings, do lunches<br>with my boss in some over-priced Manhattan bistro,<br>walk into fancified Fifth Avenue shops. Now I’m<br>more of a clothes jackass…what’s known in more<br>forgiving circles as a t-shirt and jeans guy. That’s<br>where my big mouth comes in.</p>



<p>My drawers are filled with t-shirts that talk. Some<br>chatter about the things I love. A few scream about<br>what I dislike. That leaves the rest to chime in on</p>



<p>the general subject of what kind of a guy I am in a<br>way that silk ties never could. Some are louder than<br>others but, forgive me, Godfather, most of them<br>love to tell everyone what I’m thinking.</p>



<p>I grew up in an Italian-American family…no, not that<br>kind of family. BUT…without ever realizing it, Vito<br>Corleone’s fatherly advice could have been<br>emblazoned on our family crest. It was never<br>spoken. It never had to be. It was just bred into us<br>somehow.</p>



<p>And then came 1967.</p>



<p>No, I’m not gonna get all tie-dyed shirty,<br>Woodstocky, love-the-one-you’re-withy on you. It’s<br>just the first I can recall seeing kids wearing clothes<br>with words on them. Suddenly I knew what they<br>were thinking, cared about, aligned with, etc.<br>without them ever having to open their mouths.<br>And it was…cool.</p>



<p>For me, 1967 was less about a sexual revolution (I<br>was 9 years old, folks) and more of a contextual</p>



<p>revolution. What my young mind didn’t process<br>until years later was this: it was advertising. As Mark<br>Twain said, “I was young and foolish then; now I am<br>older and foolisher.”</p>



<p>Some of my shirts are simply like autographs which<br>are really just proof that you’ve met someone you<br>admire or visited a place that impressed you like my<br>Ausable Chasm t-shirt. One proves that I once<br>enjoyed walking the halls of the Vinegar Museum in<br>Enemy Swim, South Dakota. Another one boasts<br>having docked my boat at Hickok’s Boat Livery (now<br>USM) over on Fish Creek. Still another proves that I<br>saw Steve Earle play in Rutland, Vermont.</p>



<p>Miscommunications have happened. Last week I<br>was proudly wearing my Pink Floyd “Darkside of the<br>Moon” t-shirt, you know the one with the prism<br>refracting a beam of light into the colors of the<br>rainbow? One kid congratulated me on my cool<br>“Pride” t-shirt. I didn’t correct him. Nor did I correct<br>the construction workers in Bloomingdale who,<br>while I was wearing my Caarhardt hoody, nodded at<br>me as if I was somehow part of their union. But my</p>



<p>ASPCA “Love My Kitty” t-shirt underneath made<br>them immediately suspicious.</p>



<p>So what’s my point? As usual, there ain’t much of<br>one. Except to say this: it’s hard to find any piece of<br>clothing, or product for that matter, that doesn’t tell<br>everyone who you are or who you think you are in<br>some way. Own a pair of Levi’s? Drive a Ram<br>pickup? Wear Nike anythings?</p>



<p>You, too, sleep with the fishes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>(The following has no basis in scientific research or fact or even<br>hearsay. It’s simply the author’s unhinged perceptions.)</strong></p>



<p>Ever since I was a little guy, I’ve always wished my<br>birthdays were celebrated with birthday pie instead<br>of birthday cake. Oh, you can still stick candles in<br>the pie, sing Happy Birthday if you must, and have<br>me make a wish and blow out the candles.</p>



<p>Just make it my “Birthday Pie.”</p>



<p>That may seem like a simple taste preference on the<br>surface: pie over cake. And, for me it is, but it’s so<br>much more. Don’t misunderstand, I love cake.<br>Chocolate, carrot, Angel food — amazing stuff. But<br>pie is a fruit-filled, flaky-crusted slice of Jack. Let me<br>explain.</p>



<p>I find that aside from preferences, cake and pie also<br>represent personalities. Cake fans tend to be social,<br>sweet, outgoing dreamers. Pie people are warm,<br>humble, down-to-earth realists.</p>



<p>A few arguable examples:</p>



<p>Jimmie Stewart: Pie<br>Cary Grant: Cake</p>



<p>Ben Afleck: Cake<br>Matt Damon: Pie</p>



<p>Paul Newman: Pie<br>Robert Redford: Cake</p>



<p>Angelina Jolie: Cake<br>Jennifer Aniston: Pie</p>



<p>Bugs Bunny: Cake<br>Elmer Fudd: Pie</p>



<p>Katherine Hepburn: Cake disguised as Pie</p>



<p>Neither are wrong, bad or misguided. We just “are-<br>who-we-are”. If only everyone on the planet shared<br>that sentiment. But, aside from our names, we<br>mortals have devised many ways of describing</p>



<p>ourselves and each other. Unfortunately, the bases<br>of most of these descriptions are offensive at best.<br>Skin color, sexual preference, religion are just a few<br>— and just awful.</p>



<p>But there are other ways.</p>



<p>Like cake or pie, there are harmless, even fun ways<br>of recognizing our differences without the<br>probability of wars, hate crimes or even hurt<br>feelings. I can’t imagine cake people hating the pie<br>folks so much that it would lead to a riot. No, I think<br>the two sides would agree that having both cake<br>and pie in the world is actually a beautiful thing. So<br>why can’t we do that with religions? Or with<br>sexuality? Or skin color?</p>



<p>Anyway, here goes:</p>



<p>What’s your peanut butter? Jif or Skippy? I’m a Jif<br>man. But I don’t hate Skippy lovers. (I don’t<br>understand them, but I don’t hate them.)<br>I can hear the Peter Pan eaters struggling to protest<br>with a mouthful of their favorite. But I’m not going</p>



<p>to spend my days looking over my shoulder for<br>angry Peter Panners. The “all-natural” peanut<br>butter advocates are probably still mixing the oil on<br>the top of their jars to notice.</p>



<p>Are you boxers? Or briefs? Now, men’s underwear<br>is a little trickier because that preference often<br>changes. Until I went away to school, I wore tighty-<br>whiteys — whatever my mom bought me. As I got<br>older, a girlfriend introduced me to boxers and I<br>was hooked (or shall I say “unhooked”) by the<br>freedom they offered. And then I tried a pair of<br>boxer/briefs and have worn them ever since. Now<br>how can anyone hold anything against anybody<br>after having walked a mile in their, uh, underwear?</p>



<p>Coke or Pepsi? Ocean or Lake? Baked or Mashed?<br>The world is full of our little harmless differences. I<br>say we use those and leave the others behind. Who<br>knows? Maybe, instead of wars that would lead to<br>peanut butter eating contests, underwear races and<br>bake-offs.</p>



<p>As long as we don’t let preference harden into<br>prejudice there won’t be any trouble. It’s as easy as<br>pie.</p>
